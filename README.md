# RasberryPi-IOT-wheater-Report-System

Description Coming soon...
In this project I used a BME280 temperature, pressure and humidity sensor to turn a Raspberry Pi into a weather station that record data.
I accessed those data remotely and  transfered them into an excel spreadsheet. This can be used to predict the weather. 

Setup 
- [RaspBerryPi + BM280](https://github.com/Fphelix/RasberryPi-IOT-wheater-Report-System/blob/main/Images/myimage1.jpg)
- [RaspBerryPi as IOT device](https://github.com/Fphelix/RasberryPi-IOT-wheater-Report-System/blob/main/Images/myimage2.jpg)
- Check out the picture [Duck Duck Go](https://github.com/Fphelix/RasberryPi-IOT-wheater-Report-System/blob/main/Images/myimage3.jpg)
- Here is the orginal code on BMe280 Github to get the temperature, humidity, and pressure and the original [Output](https://github.com/Fphelix/RasberryPi-IOT-wheater-Report-System/blob/main/Images/myimage3.jpg) that I got after running some [Bash Script](https://github.com/Fphelix/RasberryPi-IOT-wheater-Report-System/blob/main/Images/myimage4.jpg )
- Then I was able to set the device outside,I had an SSH and I accessed the data on PUTTY. I also did some minor changes to the code to make sure that I am getting some good data and I was able to access my [IOT Data]( https://github.com/Fphelix/RasberryPi-IOT-wheater-Report-System/blob/main/Images/myimage5.jpg)  remotly with the same Bash Script. 
- As you can see I had the [daily waetherforcast](https://github.com/Fphelix/RasberryPi-IOT-wheater-Report-System/blob/main/Images/myimage6.PNG) from my phone and the numbers were pretty good. 
- Coming soon: Writing a bash script to transfer the data to an excel spreadsheet
- Future Implementation : Smart Irrigation System
