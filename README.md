# RasberryPi-IOT-wheater-Report-System

Description Coming soon...
In this project I used a BME280 temperature, pressure and humidity sensor to turn a Raspberry Pi into a weather station that record data.
I accessed those data remotely and  transfered them into an excel spreadsheet. This can be used to predict the weather.
